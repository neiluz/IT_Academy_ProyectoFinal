    "Para llevar a cabo en este proyecto la recolección de datos, se utilizará la librería Twint, una herramienta de web scrapping de Twitter que permite obtener tweets públicos sin necesidad de una API. La ventaja de utilizar Twint radica en su capacidad de obtener información de usuarios que no se encuentran disponibles mediante las APIs, así como de aquellos usuarios que han eliminado o bloqueado sus cuentas. Con esta herramienta, se podrá obtener una gran cantidad de datos en un corto período de tiempo, lo que permitirá construir una base de datos completa y representativa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Además, Twint ofrece varias opciones de filtrado para especificar las palabras clave, el idioma, el rango de fechas, entre otros criterios, lo que permitirá obtener tweets relevantes y útiles para nuestro análisis de sentimientos. Con esta estrategia, se espera obtener una base de datos de alta calidad y representativa de la población objetivo, lo que aumentará la fiabilidad y validez de los resultados."
